# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Your Task

I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.
